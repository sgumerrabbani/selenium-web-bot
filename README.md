1) Organize and update episodes.xlsx with the corresponding series [remove first row!]
2) download images using imager.py (ensure format matches and is saved in downloads folder)
3) Create the first episode of the series and note the ID number
4) ID number will be start_id in downloader2.py
5) start_id + (total episodes-1) = end_id number in downloader2
6) Double-check after the script has completed running to check if the inputs are accurate
 
*there are 2 start ids and 2 end ids
NOTE: CANNOT WORK WITH DUPLICATE IDS (IE EPISODES CREATED THEN DELETED LATER WILL CAUSE ISSUES)  if this happens contact Umer to fix
NOTE: Laptop must be on (not in sleep mode otherwise selenium will terminate)
